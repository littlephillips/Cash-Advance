Set up a new React project with Bootstrap. You can do this by using the Create React App tool and then adding Bootstrap as a dependency.

Create a login page where the credit officer can enter their credentials to log in to the dashboard. You can use React components for this and style them with Bootstrap classes.

Once the credit officer has logged in, create a main dashboard component that displays the relevant information. This could include options to create a new loan, view existing loans, and manage loan applications.

Create a loan application form within the dashboard component that allows the credit officer to capture loan applicant bio data and business history. You can use Bootstrap form components and input fields for this.

Include a map component that allows the credit officer to pin the business location of the loan applicant. You can use a third-party map library, such as Google Maps or Mapbox, and integrate it into your React app.

Add a feature to create a loan for a customer within the dashboard component. You can use a form to capture loan details, such as the loan amount, interest rate, and repayment period. Once the credit officer submits the form, you can use an API to create the loan in your database.

Style the dashboard component with Bootstrap classes to make it visually appealing and easy to use.
